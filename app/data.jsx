    question: "How much does product development cost?",
    answer:
      "For product development, we keep low startup costs and a 10-40% revenue share in the new product. Our product development is end-to-end, covering everything from design &amp; planning to upgrades &amp; marketing. We treat this as a new business, not just a project for a client. We treat each new business as an independent entity, with its own systems and teams. Clients retain majority ownership while we manage operations, ensuring their involvement is as minimal or extensive as they prefer.",

    question: "Why are we different",
    answer:
      "Agencidev is not a traditional marketing agency focused solely on acquiring clients. We are not a creative agency either focused on design, branding and websites. Instead, we focus on our client’s business ecosystem growth as a whole. We build great agencies. We want to give every client a luxury experience. We don’t just care about the food on the plate. We care about every small detail—from how the food is presented to the temperature of the restaurant to the type of plate material used to the perfume the waiter wears. We pay attention to the details many don’t even know exist. Because when stacked together, these seemingly invisible small details add up to become excellence. And that is what we aim to embody."
